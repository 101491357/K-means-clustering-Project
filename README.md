# K-means-clustering-Project Summary
#I employed K-means clustering to segment customers based on purchase behavior, basis of purchase, and demographics. To ensure proper scaling, I utilized StandardScaler from the sklearn library, which normalized the feature values. After fitting the model, I identified distinct customer clusters and analyzed their characteristics, focusing on variables like total volume, transaction frequency, and promotional purchases.

#To deepen the analysis, I implemented logistic regression to predict high-value customer segments. I trained the model on 80% of the dataset and used the remaining 20% to evaluate performance. Using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and a classification report, I assessed the modelâ€™s predictions. Additionally, I calculated cumulative lift and gain curves to visualize how well the model distinguished value segments.

#Throughout this project, I demonstrated proficiency in Python, data manipulation using Pandas, and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. By combining machine learning techniques with business-oriented insights, I effectively differentiated value and non-value customer segments.
